# the bramble box

The bramble box is a recipe box focused on creating seasonal meals from either farmer market ingredients and/or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) boxes.

## Inspiration

I have used CSA for my main source of groceries for a few years and I love it. I like that I directly support the farmers who work tirelessy to feed us. I sometimes get stumped on what to make and will spend some time researching ways to prepare a new vegetable. I wanted to create a recipe box that was focused on the seasonality of a CSA box.

## Functionality

The first steps of this app was to focus on the basics (create, delete, and search). Recipes can be searched by ingredient, seasonality, or course.
